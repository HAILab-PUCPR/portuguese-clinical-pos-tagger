# portuguese-clinical-pos-tagger
A portuguese clinical POS-Tagger model trained with Flair.

The scripts included in this repository were developed in the paper [**Defining a state-of-the-art POS-tagging environment for Brazilian Portuguese clinical texts**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42600-020-00067-7).

You are free to use the available model, as long as you cite properly.
